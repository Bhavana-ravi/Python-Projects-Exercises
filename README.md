This repository contains my Python learning journey, including exercises, practice problems, and small projects created while following tutorials. It covers Python basics such as variables, loops, functions, OOP, and file handling, along with beginner-friendly projects like calculators, games, and utilities. The goal of this repository is to strengthen my Python fundamentals, improve problem-solving skills, and document my progress through hands-on coding.
